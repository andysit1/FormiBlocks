# FormiBlocks
Prototype - Blocks of Code that can be run on the user's computer

# Idea

I was working on a Jarvis for fun to interact between an llm and code. Realized that it was a large problem and this is my repo to break down the functionality. Here we will build "blocks" of functions that can be pluged and played in the a system that calls it base on a code. In the future maybe we can make a UI to call these or an llm to transcribe the call to formatted.

## Dream outcome

In the future, I want my voice to be transcribed into a code D-WDX (TBD). Which then will pushed to the API to be processed an ran on our local computer. Thought it would be interesting since it would allow all the libraries in python to be used through a local sever. Handling terminal, project setup, or other bat file automated files.

These code blocks can then be created with AI agents. Ideally, since it's small it would be able to create powerful scripts that can come bigger system that do powerful tasks. Community would be an important aspect so that we have developer creating their own plugins/blocks of code that can work together.
